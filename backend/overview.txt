Project Overview:

We built a RESTful backend API using Laravel 12 + MySQL for an Online Course Platform, designed to work with a React frontend.
The backend is frontend-driven in features but frontend-independent in code.
Authentication & Security (COMPLETED)
Technology
Laravel Sanctum
Token-based authentication (Bearer tokens)

Implemented Features
User Registration
User Login
User Logout
Get Current User (/api/me)
Route protection using auth:sanctum

Endpoints
POST   /api/register
POST   /api/login
POST   /api/logout
GET    /api/me
Security
Password hashing
Token revocation on logout
Protected API routes
Validation for all inputs

🗄️ Database & Schema Design (COMPLETED)
Database
MySQL
Clean relational design

Foreign key constraints enforced

Tables Created
Table	Purpose
users	Users
courses	Courses
lessons	Course lessons
enrollments	User-course relation
progresses	Lesson completion tracking
quizzes	Course quizzes
certificates	Completion certificates
personal_access_tokens	Sanctum tokens

All migrations:
Run cleanly
Ordered correctly
Reversible

📚 Courses & Lessons (COMPLETED)
Features
Browse courses
View course details
Create courses (protected)
Lessons attached to courses

Endpoints
GET    /api/courses
GET    /api/courses/{id}
POST   /api/courses

Relationships

Course ➝ hasMany Lessons

Lesson ➝ belongsTo Course

🧾 Enrollments (COMPLETED)
Features
User enrolls in course
Prevent duplicate enrollment
Fetch user’s enrolled courses

Endpoints
POST   /api/courses/{id}/enroll
GET    /api/my-courses

Relationships
User ↔ Course (Many-to-Many via enrollments)

📊 Progress Tracking (COMPLETED)
Features

Mark lessons as completed
Calculate course progress percentage
Progress tracked per user, per lesson

Endpoints
POST   /api/lessons/{id}/complete
GET    /api/courses/{id}/progress

Logic

Progress % = completed lessons / total lessons

Uses progresses table

🎓 Certificates (COMPLETED)
Features
Certificate issued when course reaches 100%
Prevent duplicate certificates
Fetch user certificates

Endpoints
POST   /api/courses/{id}/certificate
GET    /api/my-certificates

Rules

One certificate per user per course

Issued only after full completion

🧠 Architecture & Best Practices (COMPLETED)
Structure

API Controllers (App\Http\Controllers\API)
Models with relationships
Clean separation of concerns
Laravel 12 routing via bootstrap/app.php
Middleware
Sanctum middleware
Throttling

JSON-only API behavior

🧪 Testing & Verification (COMPLETED)

Tested all endpoints using Postman

Verified:

Auth flow
Token protection
Database writes
Progress calculations
Certificate issuance
